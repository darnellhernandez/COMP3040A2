## INSTRUCTIONS
	
Hello, these instructions can help a user host their resume on Git and change the layout to a pre-set theme.

> The user first has to convert their resume document into a Markdown file. To create a Markdown file, a Markdown editor can be used to write it. Some Markdown editors that can be used are Atom and VSCode. Any Markdown editor can be used, it just depends on what your comfortable with. The editor used for this assignment specifically was VSCode. 

> VSCode has nice features where you can see live previews and preview it with the GitHub Flavoured Markdown Plugin, so it fit very well with our assignment details. It is also an editor that is free to download online.

> You can create your new Markdown file (extension .md) in your Markdown editor of choice and convert your resume using Markdown syntax. Below are some basic features in Markdown. 

#### HOW TO USE BASIC FEATURES IN MARKDOWN

1. **LINES**. Lines can be use to separate text. A blank new line is used to separate text. If there is no empty line in between, the texts will be beside each other.

2. **HEADERS.** Headers are used to separate text and to show different sizes of text. The Number of " # " placed in front of the text will change the size and separation with 1 " # " being the largest.

	# HEADER1 
	`Markdown # Header1`
	## HEADER2 
	`Markdown ## Header2`
	### HEADER3 
	`Markdown ### Header3`

3. **BOLD and _ITALICED_ TEXT**. Bold and italiced text can be use to differentiate between different text for importance. Bold text is implemented by placing 2 " * " at the before and after the text wanted to bold. Italiced text is implemented by placing 1 " _ " before and after text wanted. 

	**HELLO** 
	`Markdown **HELLO**`
	
	_BYE_ 
	`Markdown _BYE_`

4. **TABLES**. Tables can be used to display information. Tables are made through the use of " | " and " --- " in specifc places. " | " is used to determine the number of rows and colums needed. A separate row is added and filled with " --- " in each column; it is placed as the second row. This row is not included as part of visible table, but is required in your markdown text. 

	`Markdown
	|    | 1  | 2  |  3 |
	|--- |--- |--- |--- |
	| 1  |    |    |    |
	| 2  |    |    |    |
	| 3  |	  |    |    |
	`

	|    | 1  | 2  |  3 |
	|--- |--- |--- |--- |
	| 1  |    |    |    |
	| 2  |    |    |    |
	| 3  |	  |    |    |	

5. **LINKS**. Links can be used to attach a link to text.Through the syntax [text](link), a user can attach a link to text.  For example, if the link was used to show other work or more resources. 

	GitHub: [darnellhernandez](https://github.com/darnellhernandez)

	`Markdown
	[darnellhernandez](https://github.com/darnellhernandez)`
