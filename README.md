## INSTRUCTIONS
	
Hello, these instructions can help a user host their resume on Git and change the layout to a pre-set theme.

In order to use a pre-set theme on Git, the user must convert their resume document into a Markdown file.

#### HOW TO BASIC FEATURES IN MARKDOWN

1. **LINES**. Lines can be use to separate text. A blank new line is used to separate text. If there is no line, the texts will be beside each other.

2. **HEADERS.** Headers are used to separate text and to show different sizes of text. The Number of " # " placed in front of the text will change the size and separation with 1 " # " being the largest.

	# HEADER1 
	`Markdown # Header1`
	## HEADER2 
	`Markdown ## Header2`
	### HEADER3 
	`Markdown ### Header3`

3. **BOLD and _ITALICED_ TEXT**. Bold and italiced text can be use to differentiate between different text for importance. Bold text is implemented by placing 2 " * " at the before and after the text wanted to bold. Italiced text is implemented by placing 1 " _ " before and after text wanted. 

	**HELLO** 
	`Markdown **HELLO**`
	
	_BYE_ 
	`Markdown _BYE_`
	
4. **TABLES**. Tables can be used to display information. Tables are made through the use of " | " and " --- " in specifc places. " | " is used to determine the number of rows and colums needed. A separate row is added and filled with " --- " in each column; it is placed as the second row. This row is not included as part of visible table, but is required in your markdown text. 

	`Markdown
	|    | 1  | 2  |  3 |
	|--- |--- |--- |--- |
	| 1  |    |    |    |
	| 2  |    |    |    |
	| 3  |	  |    |    |
	`

	|    | 1  | 2  |  3 |
	|--- |--- |--- |--- |
	| 1  |    |    |    |
	| 2  |    |    |    |
	| 3  |	  |    |    |	


Once the resume is a Markdown file, a user can put it on Git. Git is a version control system that is free to use, and it is where we can host the markdown file.

In order to start, a user must make a Git account to use the system. If you have an account already, you may skip this step.

#### HOW TO SIGNUP FOR GIT ACCOUNT

Once, the userâ€™s account is confirmed. They can now place their resume on Git. 

In order to do that, a user must transfer their Markdown file to Git. 

#### HOW TO USE BASIC FEATURES IN GIT
